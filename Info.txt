We need the following things for RabbitMQ Listener

1)RabbitMQ Configuration file
  RabbitMQConfig.java

2)RabbitMQ Listener class  (We don't need to configure this class any where, @RabbitListener method will be called automatically)
  @RabbitListener(queues = "VasuQueue1") method will be called when a message comes to the queue

1)Start the RabbitMQ sender application and send the messages  http://localhost:8080/javainuse-rabbitmq/producer?empName=emp1&empId=emp001 

2)Start the RabbitMQ Listener application and see the consumed messages in the console

mvn clean install

mvn spring-boot:run
